# What is it?

I made this simple Laravel application to learn how to use Laravel. I would like to hear some feedback about what I should improve and what I might need to learn.

You can:

1. Register/login/edit profile
2. Add/edit/delete tasks

# Set up

1. Edit .env file to connect to your database.
2. Use migrations to create all necessary tables by typing "php artisan migrate" in composer.
3. Type "php artisan db:seed" to input some necessary data in to groups table.
